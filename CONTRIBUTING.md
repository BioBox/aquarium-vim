# The Aquarium Contributing Guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for investing your time in contributing to this theme!

Read the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), or not, its a formality thing after all.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

### How to make a PR to Aquarium Theme

   - Make a fork of any of the Quiet Theme repositories
   - Write or modify a theme for a program using the Aquarium palette
   - Make sure you respect Base 16 standards, as aquarium is based on this
   - Commit themes to the [program_name]/ folder in your fork of the repository
   - Open a PR. Make sure the PR name tells us the program name
   - Wait for someone to approve or suggest tweaks (or make some themselves)
   - PR is merged!

Again, please ensure that all your work, or work you are using is licensed under compatible, open-source licenses.
